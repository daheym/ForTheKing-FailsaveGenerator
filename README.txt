Welcome to ForTheKing-FailsaveGenerator!

While playing ForTheKing it may happen that a corrupted savegame is generated,
which essentially means that you loose all your progress. This little GUI lets
you generate failsaves (i.e. copies of the current save) in regular intervals
to which you can fall back in case a corrupted save is generated.

This program can also be used to generate regular backup copies from any file
you want.

You can pack the program into a standalone *.exe by using PyInstaller. The 
provided .zip file already contains an executable version of the python script.
