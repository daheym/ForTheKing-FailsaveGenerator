Welcome to ForTheKing-FailsaveGenerator!

While playing ForTheKing it may happen that a corrupted savegame is generated,
which essentially means that you loose all your progress. This little GUI lets
you generate failsaves (i.e. copies of the current save) in regular intervals
to which you can fall back in case a corrupted save is generated.
