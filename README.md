While playing ForTheKing it may happen that a corrupted savegame is 
generated, which essentially means that you loose all your progress. 

This little GUI lets you generate failsaves (i.e. copies of the current save) 
in regular intervals to which you can fall back in case a corrupted save is 
generated. 

This program can also be used to generate regular backup copies from any file you want.
You can pack the program into a standalone *.exe by using PyInstaller.
